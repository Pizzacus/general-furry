# \#general_furry

This is a Discord Bot that reads messages from a "Source Channel", and applies
many filters to them before reposting them to a "Target Channel".

The goal of those filters is to imitate the stereotypical "furry speech".

Since this bot was made quickly you have to enter your bot token and the id of
the source and the target channel in the code by editing the first three
variables ^-^

Once the bot starts, it will automatically fill the target channel with
webhooks, you don't need to worry about that.

## How it looks like
